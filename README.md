- Error Handling: If an error occurs during the API request, an error message is displayed to alert the user.

## My process

During the development of the Meme Generator App, I followed a mobile-first workflow to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the app and implemented DOM manipulation and asynchronous JavaScript techniques to fetch data from the Meme API.
